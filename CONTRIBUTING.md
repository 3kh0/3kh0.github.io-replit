# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for wanting to contribute to our project. Before you do though, please give this document a short read so you get along with the people you're working with. Here are some quick tooltips that will help.

1. Try and find a common ground. <br>
Sometimes, you'll disagree with your fellow devs. That's alright, happens all the time. Thing is, that disagreement has to be resolved somewhere. Try and find a middle ground that helps both parties.

2. Join the Discord (No, really) <br>
We coordinate most of our work and stuff in the Discord, so please join. You can find the invite in the [ReadMe.](./README.md)

3. Be nice. <br>
Being nice goes a long way. So, try and do that.

4. Comment your code. <br>
Someone may need to do a last minute fix, and they can't do that if they can't find where to do that! Be sure to comment code that can't have it purpose discerned quickly.

5. Try and tackle older issues<br>
Sometimes, we'll have a backlog of issues that need to be fixed. Do everyone a favor and start going through those. It's a quick way to make everyone like you a little bit more.

That's it. And don't forget, <i>to have fun.</i>
