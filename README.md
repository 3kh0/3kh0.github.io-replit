# 3kh0.github.io Replit

This repo is now real 3kh0 v4 patched to work on replit!

This was made due to the fact that the repo size is too broken + used to be too big for replit.

## Running

[![Run on Replit](https://binbashbanana.github.io/deploy-buttons/buttons/remade/replit.svg)](https://replit.com/github/3kh0/3kh0.github.io-replit)

Running this is super easy!

1. Click on the button above to clone the repo to a new replit.
2. Click on the green Run button.
3. Click on the link that is shown in console.
4. That's it!

It is really just that simple to run a 3kh0 clone on replit
