# 3kh0.github.io Replit Version

This repo is a mirror of 3kh0 v4 for replit!

This was made due to the fact that the normal 3kh0 v4 is unstable for use on Replit.

## Running

[![Run on Replit](https://binbashbanana.github.io/deploy-buttons/buttons/remade/replit.svg)](https://replit.com/github/3kh0/3kh0.github.io-replit)

Running this is super easy!

1. Click on the button above to clone the repo to a new replit.
2. Click on the green Run button.
3. Click on the link that is shown in console.
4. That's it!

It is really just that simple!


## Differences

The Replit version is a cut down version of 3kh0.github.io, with the features pulled from the main 3kh0 repository.

That's pretty much it!
