# 3kh0.github.io Replit Version

This repo is a mirror of 3kh0 v4 for replit!

This was made due to the fact that the normal 3kh0 v4 is unstable for use on Replit.

## Differences

The Replit version is a cut down version of 3kh0.github.io, with the features pulled from the main 3kh0 repository.

That's pretty much it!
